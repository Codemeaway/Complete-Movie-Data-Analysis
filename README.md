## Complete-Movie-Data-Analysis
This project analyzes movie data from TMDB using Python and its libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and JSON. The data includes all movies released in 2022 and was obtained using the TMDB API with an API key.
## Objective

The objective of this project is to explore and analyze movie data to gain insights and trends for movies released in 2022. 

### Data Collection

The data was collected using the TMDB API. The API key was used to make HTTP requests and obtain data in JSON format. The obtained JSON data was then processed and cleaned using Python and its libraries. The cleaned data was converted to a CSV file for further analysis.

### Data Analysis

The cleaned movie data was analyzed using various Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib. Exploratory data analysis techniques were used to explore the data and gain insights into the trends and patterns of movies released in 2022. 

The analysis included the following steps:

1. Data cleaning: Removing duplicate values, handling missing values, and converting data types.
2. Data visualization: Creating different types of charts and graphs such as bar charts and word cloud to visualize the data.

### Findings

The movie data analysis project successfully explored and analyzed the movie data to gain insights into the trends and patterns of movies released in 2022. The analysis revealed interesting findings about the most successful movies in terms of profit and popularity, as well as the best movies of the year according to genres.

The top 5 most successful movies in terms of profit were found, and it was found that Avatar:The Way of Water is the most successful movie in terms of profit and popularity. The worst 5 movies were also identified in terms of popularity and profit. Interestingly, the highest rated movies were not necessarily the same as the most profitable ones.

Additionally, the best movies of the year according to genres were identified, including the best action movie, comedy movie, drama movie, and more. 

This project provides valuable information for movie lovers who are looking for the best movies to watch, as well as for movie industry professionals who can use the insights gained from this analysis to make informed decisions about their future projects.
